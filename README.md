This is a redesign/improvement on a previous project. It's an app you can use to search for books using the Google Books API and save your favorites to your own library.

Planned improvements:
- Make the code generally easier to read by renaming and re-organizing variables/functions/files
- Create an actual bookshelf with CSS and organize the library by giving each bookshelf in the database its own shelf on the library page
- Incorporate the Amazon ItemSearch API to show links to each book on amazon.com
